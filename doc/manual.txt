What is Tagaini-Jisho?
======================

Tagaini Jisho is an open source[^OSS] Japanese dictionary application. It is
designed to help students of the Japanese language in their study by providing
powerful tools to search, organise and study Japanese vocabulary and kanji
entries.

### Search
* Complete Japanese vocabulary and kanji Dictionaries, with more than
  140,000 vocabulary and 12,000 kanji entries;
* Full wild-card support in textual search;
* Radical and component-based kanji look-up, including an input method that 
  lets you find almost any kanji, as long as you can recognise some of its
  components;
* JLPT classifications of vocabulary and kanji.

### Organise
* A study list that keeps track of all the vocabulary and kanji entries you
  wish to study;
* `Sets` let you easily remember any search, allowing you to quickly access
  queries like "*What were the JLPT-2 kanji that I added to my study list
  this week?*";
* Notes and tags can be applied to entries, allowing you to group entries in a
  way that makes sense to you;
* Hierarchical and ordered lists provide an easy way to classify vocabulary
  and kanji found in textbooks or to organise them arbitrarily.

### Study
* Stroke order animations for more than 6000 kanji;
* Transparent connection of related entries, including transitive / 
  intransitive verb references, Homophones and Homographs. Tagaini maximises
  the logical connections between elements of the Japanese language in order
  to facilitate their memorisation;
* Flash cards for vocabulary and kanji entries that remember which entries you
  are having difficulty memorising so that Tagaini may display them more
  frequently. 
* Production of printed material, including a handy fold-able booklet to study
  anywhere.

This version of the Tagaini Jisho documentation has been written using Tagaini
Jisho 0.2.6. It is possible that some aspects of the program have been left
out or are ambiguous. If so, please feel free to contact the author or the
Tagaini mailing list. Contact details can be found in the [contact
section][Contact] on either the website or this document.

The GUI
-------

Tagaini Jisho's GUI, when opened for the first time, displays the search panel
(upper right), the lists view (left), and the detailed view (bottom right).

![The GUI](images/gui.png)

The **search panel** provides a series of search filters that allows you to
perform queries according to some search criteria. In order to avoid
cluttering the GUI with the many search options, only one filter can be
visible at a time, when you click its button. Once a search is run, its
results are displayed under the search filters, in the form of a short
description that allows you to spot the ones you were specifically after.
The area this list is shown in is called the **results view**.

Tagaini remembers your searches, and you can go back and forward through them
using the left and right arrow at the top left of the results view, next to
where it displays the number of results. By default, the results view will
only list up to 50 entries. Beyond that, they will be put on a new page. Which
page you are viewing is controlled with the buttons at the top right of the
list.

Below the search panel is the **detailed view**, which displays any and all
information about a selected entry. The buttons above the view allow you to go
back and forward through selected entries and to manipulate the displayed
entry.

When you right click on an entry in the results window, a context menu opens.
In the context menu are the same actions that are along the top of the
detailed view, as well as a *Select All* option. Right clicking on links to
other entries in the detailed view has the same effect, and provides an *Open
in detailed view...* option which opens the entry in the detailed view. You
may also left click on the link or magnifying glass icon to access referenced
entries.

Tagaini's views can also be resized, moved or hidden in order to adapt the
interface to your current activity, available screen surface, or way of
working. To hide a panel, simply click on the *x* icon at the right of their
toolbar. A hidden panel can be made visible again using the corresponding
action in the **Search** menu or its keyboard shortcut. Clicking and dragging
on a view's toolbar will let you detach and move it around the workspace.

Searching Entries
=================

Tagaini Jisho is, above all, a very powerful dictionary program. It allows you
to search for terms and kanji even if you have limited information about them,
and connects them to related entries. This chapter covers the basic usage
of the application. 

Any search for vocabulary or kanji entries takes place in the search panel.
It's top bar features a couple of buttons, as well as accessors to the various
search filters.

![Results view options](images/search_titlebar.png)

The first button displays a list of print/export options to apply to the
currently displayed results, and is explained in a latter section. The second
button lets you reset the current search, bringing the search panel back to an
empty state. It is also accessible through the **Ctrl+r** shortcut

The drop down box to the left of that is the **entry type selector**, and lets
you filter which type of entry you want to search. Tagaini references both
dictionary (words) and kanji (characters) entries, and by default searches for
both type of entries. But some searches may only make sense for one type - for
instance if you want to specifically study kanji for a test.

Next are labelled buttons which give you access to the various search filters.
Tagaini lets you search for entries according to many different criteria, each
one being accessible through its own filter that appears if the button is
pressed. When a search filter is in use, a reset button similar to the search
panel's reset button will appear on the filter's button. This button will only
reset search options within that filter.

The last noticeable element of the search panel's toolbar is the Tagaini logo,
which will animate as a search takes place. You can stop a long search
by clicking it.

There are seven search filters located in the view's toolbar. By default [Text
Search][The Text Filter] is selected, and the text search filter is displayed.
The other search tabs are labelled: [Study][The Study Filter]; [JLPT][The JLPT
Filter]; [Tags; Notes][The Tags and Notes Filters]; [Vocabulary][The
Vocabulary Filter]; [Kanji][The Kanji Filter]. Clicking on a different filter
shows the new filter in place of the current one. It is also possible to
select a filter through keyboard short cuts. Holding down control (**ctrl**)
and pressing the corresponding number, one through seven (**1** - **7**),
while **Ctrl+0** hides them all.

The Text Filter
---------------

![Text filter](images/search_text.png)

The text search filter is used for entering textual search terms. The text
field also acts as a drop down box, allowing previously searched terms to be
found and reused easily. You can enter words, or terms, to search for into the
text field and then, when you either press the enter key or the search button,
it will search for the terms in the search bar.

Search terms are character-set sensitive and can be combined. For instance, if
you enter "`しけん`" into the search bar it will result in 試験 (test), 私見
(personal opinion) and 私権 (private right.) If, however, you enter "`しけん
test`", it will search both terms and only display 試験 (test) as Tagaini
will only display entries for which all the search terms match.

Every search term is separated by spaces, or double quotes (`""`). To search
for a sentence which includes spaces, you can enclose the sentence in
quotation marks. For instance, if you search for `to run`, then Tagaini will
find and list every entry with both the word `to` and `run` in it. If instead
you search `"to run"`, then Tagaini will only find entries with the words "to
run" in them in that order, which probably makes sense if you are looking for
the verb.

As Tagaini matches terms to entries exactly, there is currently no romaji
search. So, searching for "`watashi`" will not result in 私：わたし. To find
an entry you must search either its kanji or hiragana reading.

When searching single-character words with the entry type selector set to
**All**, it is quite common to come across two similar-looking entries, such
as two entries for 私 or 駅. These entries will usually come up for single
kanji words. This happens because it is displaying an entry for the word, and
an entry for the kanji. The two different entries will have information about
different things. This is discussed further in the next section.

Tagaini supports *wild cards*[^wildcards]. The `*` character represents an
unknown string. Placing it at the end of a term searches for everything
beginning with that term, placing it at the beginning of a term searches for
everything ending with that term and placing it in the middle of the a term
searches for everything that starts and ends with that part of the term. The
`?` character represents a single unknown character but otherwise works the
same way. So `大*` represents everything that starts with 大 and `*す`
represents everything that ends with す. If the `?` character was used instead
then then `大?` would be any two character entry where the first was 大 and
`?す` would be any two character entry that ends with す. Wild-cards are
especially useful for looking up a word you cannot read entirely.

[^wildcards]: Wild cards are characters used to represent unknown characters
	      in search terms. 

The Study Filter
----------------
	
![The Study Extender](images/search_study.png)

The study tab filters through searches according to whether or not the entry
is on the study list. Tagaini indeed lets you mark entries you want to study
and keeps lots of statistics about them, including a score that represents how
well you remember it. The study status defaults to *None*, so it does not
filter results. Changing this to *Studied* will cause only entries in the
study list to be listed in the search panel. *Not studied* causes only results
not in the study list to be shown[^studynum].

To add entries to the study list, either right click on them in the results
view, or use the detailed view toolbar and click the blue flag, *Add to study
list*, which adds the entry to the list with a score of 0. The green flag,
*Already known*, will add the entry with a score of 95. 

Each entry is given a colour between red and green according to its score, and
it is displayed as the entry's background in the search panel. As you
practise[^practicefoot], the score on each entry in your study list will
change. You will then be able to filter entries that you know you know from
your searches. When the study status is set to *studied* Tagaini will only
search through entries that have a score within the range of *Min* and *Max*,
the values from the score section.

The study date section filters entries according to the date the entry was
added to the study list. Clicking any of the not set buttons, in this section
or the others, brings up a calendar to select a date or allows you to set a
number of days／weeks／months／years prior to today's date. If an entry has
been added after the *since* date and before the *until* date then it will be
listed in the search panel in any searches.

The last trained section allows you to set a time range for finding entries
according to when you last practised it, and the last mistaken section allows
you to set a time range for when you last made a mistake on the entry.

[^practicefoot]: See [Study List][] for more information on practising with
your study list, as well as manipulating it. 

[^studynum]: Just setting the status to *not studied* without any other search
criteria will cause every entry not in the study list to be listed. This is
likely to be a very large number of entries.

The JLPT Filter
---------------

JLPT stands for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. It is a test
administered by the *Japan Foundation* and *Japan Educational Exchanges and
Services* for the purposes of evaluating and certifying the Japanese language
proficiency of non-native speakers.[^jlptfoot]

Up until 2010 there have been four levels, with level 4 being the lowest and 1
being the highest. The JLPT filter lets you filter vocabulary and kanji
entries according to the JLPT level they are likely to show in. You can check
several levels. Please keep in mind that although this information can
probably be considered reliable, it is only given for informational purposes,
as there is no official JLPT lists of vocabulary and kanji.

Starting from 2010, there are 5 JLPT levels - former level 4 corresponds to
N5, former level 3 to N4, former level 2 to N2 and former level 1 to N1. There
are not as yet vocabulary lists of known vocabulary associated to the N3 level.

[^jlptfoot]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Language_Proficiency_Test  
http://www.jlpt.jp/e/

![The JLPT Extender](images/search_jlpt.png)

The Tags and Notes Filters
--------------------------

Tags and Notes are similar in that they both label entries. They can be added
to entries with either the right click menu in the search panel or the
detailed views toolbar.

![The Tags Extender](images/search_tags.png)

Tags are short strings used to identify an entry. Each tag is a single
word given to an entry that can be used as a filter. For instance, if you
first come across a word in a given book, you can mark it with the book's
name so that you are able to quickly find entries you learnt in the same
context. Typing tags into the filter will search through just the entries with
those tags. There is also a drop down list to the right of the text field
which contains a complete list of tags, so you can just select the ones you
want.

If an entry has a tag, a small tag icon will be displayed on the right side of
the entry in the search panel, next to the scroll bar and at the bottom of
the entry in the detailed view.

To add a tag, you can use the **Add tags...** button, which looks like a tag
with a green bit at the top. White space, or spaces, separate each tag, so
writing "`genki ch04`" adds two tags: "`genki`" and "`ch04`".

Any tags you have added with the **Add tags...** button in the current
session[^tagainisession] can be found again in the **Recently added tags...**
sub menu of the context menu[^contextmenu], which makes adding tags to a set
of entries easier. The **Set tags...** button brings up a list of all the
current tags attached to an entry so that they can be edited. Additional tags
can be entered here. Despite the **Add tags...** button not bringing up tags
that have already been set on an entry, adding new ones does not overwrite the
existing ones, it just appends them to the list.

[^tagainisession]: A session is started each time you run the program. If you
run Tagaini, use it for five minutes and close it, then that is one session.
If you run it again five minutes later then you are running a different
session.

[^contextmenu]: Right click menu.

Notes are like yellow post-it notes that you can add to an entry. You could
use notes to describe the relationship between one word and another or any other
information you judge note-worthy about the entry. For instance, if a word,
such as 降る、appears in a textbook you are studying in a phrase, such as
雨が降る/雨が降ります、in a chapter before the entry itself, you may wish note
that in the entry. In the example one may write "`Appears in chapter n of
textbook_name as 雨が降る`".

When you search with the **Notes** filter, the search will match any entries
with whatever text you write in the text field, exactly. If, using the above
example, you have two different entries on verbs that have been used in
phrases and have noted this, if you search for "`Appears in`" it will find both
of these entries, however if they are in separate chapters and you extend that
string to "`Appears in chapter 5`", then it will only find the one that has that
exactly. 

To add a note, use the **Edit notes...** button, which looks like a yellow
stick-it note pad and a pen. It will bring up a window with any existing
notes. You can edit existing notes by selecting them and editing them, add new
notes with the **New note** button, and delete notes. 

The Vocabulary Filter
---------------------

![Vocabulary Filter](images/search_vocabulary.png)

The **vocabulary filter** has vocabulary specific filter options. It can not
be used in conjunction with the kanji filter.

The first two text fields relate to the kanji found in vocab entries. The
**With kanji** field will find any vocab entry that contains a list of given
kanji. Next to it is a check-box labelled **Using studied kanji only**. It
forces the search to use only kanji from the study list, and may be useful to
find new words that you should be able to read, but are not necessarily
studying.

Kanji are made up of different sub-kanji, or components, so the **With
components** field searches for kanji that include a component. This feature
is useful to find words that you cannot write, but for which you can identify
some of their components. For instance, say you are looking for the word
"`紅葉`". You cannot read it, but can recognise the `糸`, `工` and `木`
components it its kanji. Entering these in the components line will display
all words which kanji feature these components, including the one you are
looking after, `紅葉`.

![Vocabulary search by components](images/search_vocabulary_components.png)

Below that are four sub menus, labelled **Part of speech**, **Dialect**,
**Field** and **Misc**. Each of these finds entries that belong to any of the
groups you select in the menus. The **Part of speech** menu allows you to
search for different parts of speech, such as nouns or verbs; **Dialect**
finds words that belong to different places in Japan; **Field** finds terms
and jargon from different fields and schools of knowledge, such as computer or
religious terms and **Misc** contains anything that doesn't belong in the
other categories, such as children's language, obsolete terms and slang. 

The Kanji Filter
----------------

![Kanji Filter](images/search_kanji.png)

The kanji filter contains filtering options specific to kanji entries and as
such cannot be used in conjunction with the vocabulary filter.

The first section on the tab, **Stroke count**, filters kanji by their number
of strokes. It is possible to specify a range by checking the corresponding
check-box.

The next section filters kanji by their radical or components.
Clicking on the **Radicals** input line will trigger a pop-up listing the 214
radicals, from which you can select those you want to filter against. Every
time a radical is selected, the radicals list updates itself to only show the
radicals that can be combined with the current selection.

![Kanji Filter](images/search_kanji_radical.png)

**Components**, acts in the same way as radicals, but broaden the concept.
While radicals are limited to a set of 214 key characters, a component can be
any part of a kanji for which a character exists, which makes searching using
components much more flexible. You can click on or input just any component
that you recognise in the kanji, and the list of complementary components will
update itself automatically, while the search for corresponding kanji is run
in the background.

Radical and component-based kanji search are very powerful kanji look-up
methods. They can also be used to insert kanji into any text input, including
the text search widget, using the [Kanji Input Panel][].

The **Unicode** section, in the middle of the tab, finds the character with
the Unicode value `0xH` where `H` is a hexadecimal[^hex] value representing
the number. No two characters have the same value. For instance, the character
`取` has a Unicode value of `0x53D6`. Putting that in the Unicode field will
result in the entry for `取` being listed.

The next section is for finding kanji by **SKIP code**. A skip code is a way
of categorising kanji according to its type. SKIP codes are comprised of three
numbers and are annotated X-Y-Z. Each slider in the **SKIP code** section
relates to one of these numbers.[^SKIPfoot]

The fifth section, or second from the right, is labelled **Four corner**. It
provides four drop down boxes corresponding to each corner of a Chinese
character and a fifth box for miscellaneous strokes. Four corner method is a
Chinese input method to used to find kanji.[^FCfoot]

The last section, **School grade**, represents which Japanese school level the
kanji is taught in.

The Detailed View
-----------------

The detailed view is the main window of Tagaini Jisho where entries are
displayed. It is the only view that cannot be hidden. If both the search and
the lists panels are hidden, then it is the only part that remains, showing
entries. This can be useful if you are reading digital text and are using the
**auto-search on clipboard content** feature found in the Search Menu. 

At the top of the detailed view there is a toolbar which contains back and
forward buttons, for transversing previously viewed entries; buttons for
marking the entry, as discussed in the [organizing entries][] chapter and
sections on [tags and notes][The Tags and Notes Filters]; and a button to
allow dragging the entry currently being viewed into a list. 

The detailed view itself displays all the information on the currently
selected entry, according to its type. [Vocabulary entries] are displayed
differently to [Kanji entries].


### Vocabulary Entries

Vocabulary entries contain information about a word, particle or expression.
The following sections are common to them.

**Main Reading**
:   Centred at the top of the view will be the way the word or phrase is
    written, with furigana written in red above it.

**Variants**
:   Any variants are listed here, with their reading in brackets.

**The definition block**
:   Here, different definitions are listed. First, it displays the definitions
    part of speech[^pos] in grey, and then lists different definitions, next
    to a flag representing the language of the definition.

**JLPT level**
:   The entry's JLPT level.

**Kanji**
:   The kanji used in the main reading, and its meanings. This is off by
    default. The kanji's JLPT level can also be appended to each reference.

**Transitive／Intransitive buddy**
:   The entry corresponding with the current entry's opposite transitive
    state.

**Homophones**
:   Entries that are homophones of the current entry. A homophone is a word
    with the same or similar pronunciation.

**Homographs**
:   Entries that are homographs of the current entry. A homograph is a word
    that is written the same way as another word with a different
    pronunciation and meaning.

Any entry referenced in the detailed view will have a little magnifying glass
next to it, which is a link to the referenced entry. For instance, in the
entry 取る it references its intransitive buddy;

    Intransitive buddy: 取れる（とれる）: to come off, to be removed.

Clicking on the magnifying glass at the end of this line would display the
entry for 取れる in the detailed view. This does not affect your current set.

[^pos]: The part-of-speech can be clicked in order to display its complete
definition.

### Kanji Entries

Kanji entries contain information about a single kanji, what it means and how
it is used. By default, the kanji is centred in the detail view window and its
meanings are listed underneath it, also centred. From there there are several
common sections.

**On**
:   The on reading, or 音読み（おんよみ）is the Chinese reading of the kanji.
    It is written in katakana.

**Kun**
:   The kun reading, or 訓読み（くんよみ）is the Japanese reading of the
    character. It is written in hiragana.

**Nanori**
:   The name readings of the kanji, or 名乗り（なのり）are readings that are
    only used in names.

**Strokes**
:   The number of strokes it takes to write the kanji. 

**Grade**
:   The grade it is taught to in Japanese schools.

**Unicode**
:   The Unicode number, in hexadecimal.

**Frequency**
:   How frequently the kanji appears in newspapers.

**JLPT**
:   The kanji's JLPT level.  

**SKIP**
:   The kanji's SKIP code.

**Radicals**
:   Formal radicals found within the kanji.

**Components**
:   The components that make up the kanji.

**Direct compounds**
:   Kanji that are made up with this kanji. 

**Seen in**
:   A list of vocabulary that contains the kanji. Following 6 words have been
    displayed is a link to find all words using that the kanji.

Although kun readings for some entries, such as verbs and adjectives, can
include any extra kana needed to use the kanji, such as 取る's る (written
と.る,) searching the full reading, including extra kana past the full
stop, will not find the kanji entry, only the vocabulary entry. To find the
kanji entry you must search for just the kanji's reading, と in 取る's case,
to find it. 

In the detailed view, you can click on any kanji, whilst looking at any entry,
and a pop up window will be displayed showing a short listing of the kanji,
and a stroke order animation. This works in both a kanji entry and a
vocabulary entry. Whilst in a kanji entry, one can also click **ctrl+s** to
display the pop up window. 

![Kanji Tool tip](images/kanji_popup.png)

The small window will pop up under your mouse. It shows the kanji's meaning,
some of its readings, Frequency, Grade and JLPT, and components. Most
notable, however, is the animation of the kanji being written. It starts
as an outline which gets filled in, stroke by stroke. Each radical is
written in a different colour. 

Moving your mouse over a component highlights it. Clicking on a component,
either on the animation or in the list, will open that component by
itself in the window. Underneath the stroke order animation are
animation control buttons, allowing you to stop; pause; play; skip
strokes and go back. Each of these buttons have corresponding keyboard
shortcuts: r, space, right and left respectively.

Up the top are three buttons. The first, the magnifying glass, opens the
kanji's entry in the detailed view. The second provides an options menu, just
as when right clicking on an entry in the search panel, and the last closes
the window. 

Radical and Component Input Panels
----------------------------------

The kanji input panels are a powerful way to easily input kanji into any text
area of Tagaini Jisho. They are usable whenever a text input area (such as the
text search filter) is focused (when you can type in one), either via the
**Search** menu of their keyboard shortcuts. The **Radical search input** is
accessible via **Ctrl+k**, and the **Component search input** via **Ctrl+j**.

![Kanji IM](images/component_popup.png)

Both work similarly to the radical and component search of [the
Kanji Filter], excepted that the results are displayed in a small area.
Clicking on a kanji displayed in this area will immediately put it into the
focused text field.

So to find 怒 using the components search input, one could start by entering
"`女`" into its text field, or by finding it listed under 3 strokes. The same
thing could be done for "`又`". The field beneath would be listing
kanji with these radicals. With this example, the desired character, 怒, can
be spotted very quickly. Clicking on the kanji will place it in the search
field, or which ever text field had the focus when the kanji input panel was
brought up. To close the panel, just clicking outside it will close it.

Organising Entries
==================

Study List
----------

The study list is an invisible list of vocabulary and kanji, used to mark
entries for study. Each entry has a score, based on how well you know the
entry. This score is represented by a background colour for the entry when
listed in the search panel. Red represents not knowing it, or having a 0
score, and green represents knowing it, or having a score of 100. The colour
gradiates from red to yellow to green as the score gets higher. Entries with
low scores are shown first.

The study list is manipulated with the flag buttons in the detailed view tool
bar and the context menu given when right clicking on entry references, either
in the search panel or the display view.

When adding entries to the study list, there are two relevant flags. The blue
flag, **Add to study list** and the green flag, **already known**. The blue
flag adds the entry with a score of 0, whilst the green flag adds the entry
with a score of 95.

After an entry has been added, the blue flag changes colour and becomes a
black flag, which removes the entry from the study list. Another flag, which
was previously greyed out, also becomes available. It is a red flag and marked
**Reset score**. It sets the entry's score to 0.

An entry's score goes up and down as you practise it.

Lists
-----

By default, **Lists** should be visible as soon as you start the program as a
panel down the left of the window. If it is not, you can access it through the
**Search** menu or the **F3** keyboard shortcut.

![Lists view](images/lists.png)

In addition to an export/print menu similar to the one of the results list,
the lists panel has three buttons. The first, which is greyed out to begin
with, is the **go up** button. The second creates a new list and the third,
a red **x**, recursively deletes the selected list and all its contents.

Each list is a tree branch in the list view panel. When a new list is created,
it does not have a parent and is named `New list`. Double clicking on the
branch will allow renaming. As every list is a branch, clicking and dragging
them onto another list will set it to be a child of that list, allowing this
lists to be embedded within each other.

Lists are useful for sorting and organising entries that may be frequently
viewed. To add an entry to a list, Drag and drop it onto one of the lists from
the search panel. Doing this creates a child entry that links to that entry.
Clicking on it in the lists view then opens the entry in the detailed view.
You can drag from the search panel, the list view (in which case the entry
will move), the drag button of the detailed view's toolbar, or any kanji or
link in the detailed view.

To delete a list and its contents, select it and click the button that looks
like a red `x`. This will display a warning that points out that the operation
will delete the list and all of its children.

Selected entries options, as well as the create and delete actions, are also
available through the right-click context menu.

Right clicking on a list in the list view will give the option to **Set as
root**. Clicking on this hides all the lists and only shows children of the
selected list. The list's name will be displayed just below the panels tool
bar. When you have set a list to the root, the **go up** button on the panel
will turn blue to signal it is usable. Clicking it will set the root to the
parent of the current root, until the root is the original root. 

Sets
----

A **set** is the list created by a search and displayed in the search panel.
Tagaini can remember specific sets. If you have made a search that you think
you will want to make again, such as all transitive verbs used in computer
terminology at the JLPT 2 level, you can create a new set, to make it easier
to find again. Think of sets as bookmarks for searches.

![Sets Menu](images/sets.png)

The **Sets** menu contains functions for creating and organising sets. Two
options allow the creation and placement of sets directly from the menu, **New
set from current search...** and **New sets folder...**, and the last,
**Organise sets...** Brings up another window for organising sets.

As you create new sets with the menu option, it displays them at the bottom of
the menu. Clicking on them there will open that set in the results window.

When you create a new menu, it too will appear in the sets menu, as a sub
menu. It will then have two options, **Create new set here...** and **Create
new folder here...**. They will act as the two options in the main sets menu,
except they will place created sets and folders as sub items of that folder.
These two options always appear at the bottom of the menu.

To organise or reorganise sets, The **Organise sets** window, found in the
sets menu, allows you to drag and drop sets into different folders, as well as
delete them. Double clicking on a set or folder will allow you to rename it.
Right clicking on the set will allow you to delete it and dragging them around
will move them to the new position. This allows you to sort them amongst
themselves as well as into new folders.

Studying Entries
================

Practice
--------

The practise menu has four different options. Settings; vocab flash cards;
kanji flash cards and reading practice. The flash card options are sub menus,
each with **by set** and **entire study list** options for reading to
translation and translation to reading.

The settings window, brought up by clicking the **Whole study list train
settings...** buttons, Which allows you to set what to include and exclude in
study exercises. The **date of last training** section specifies what to
include based on the last time it was studied. It defaults to before
yesterday, so it won't include anything that you have already studied in the
last twenty four hours. The score section specifies what to include based on
score. If you only want to study things you are less familiar with you can
change it to **between 0 and 50** and it would only show you red to yellow
entries. The **sort bias** specifies if entries with a low score should be
more likely to appear before entries with higher scores.

### Flashcards

There are four options in total in the flashcards sub-menus: **From Japanese,
whole study set**; **From Japanese, current set**; **From translation, whole
study set** and **from translation, current set**. Each option will display
different contents in the same window. It will either show the translation or
reading first, from an entry that has been pulled either from the study list
or the current set.

![Vocab Training](images/practice_flashcards.png)

The flashcard window has four buttons up the top; **Answer** and **Skip**, as
well as two initially greyed out options, **Correct** and **Wrong**.
Underneath this is a detailed display window. It will only display part of an
entry initially. Either the Japanese if you have selected **from Japanese**,
or the definition. 

If you have selected a **from Japanese** option for vocabulary flashcards,
then there is an extra option along the detailed view toolbar, **Show
furigana**, a check-box which toggles whether or not the furigana for the entry
is displayed.

When you have decided whether or not you know the answer, pressing the answer
button will display the rest of the entry, just as it would in the detailed
display. You can then tell Tagaini if you got it correct or incorrect, which
modifies the entry's score, or skip the entry, which doesn't change it at
all.

![Kanji Training](images/tagaini_train_kanji.png)

Whilst the whole entry is displayed, you can use the detailed view as normal,
however the toolbar is greyed out before hitting the answer button. When you
tell Tagaini how well you remembered the entry, it goes to a new entry at
random, and you can repeat the process until you have run out of entries in
the set. Down the bottom of the view some statistics are displayed.

    Correct: 5, Wrong: 1, Total: 6

The numbers correspond to how well you are doing in that particular set. Every
time you start using the flash cards, even with the same set, the numbers are
all set back to 0.

### Reading Practice

The last option in the practice menu is **reading practice, whole study set**.
It brings up the **reading practice** window, which is a bit different to the
flash card window.

![Reading Practise](images/tagaini_train_reading.png)

The window shows you a vocab entry's written form, and asks you to type the
correct reading for the entry. Underneath the text field, it has a detailed
display which shows only the entry's definitions. You must type the entry in
kana (かな) to get entries correct, it will not accept romaji answers, though
it does not mind if the answer is in hiragana ひらがな or katakana かたがな.

![Reading Practise Error](images/tagaini_train_reading_batsu.png)

When you get the answer correct it displays the word **Correct** in green
writing between the detailed display and the text field and moves immediately
on to the next entry. When you get the entry incorrect, however, it displays
**Error!** in red writing between the text field and the detailed view and
changes the text field into a long next button. The detailed view shows the
entire entry so you can see where you went wrong. When you press the next
button it will show the next entry.

Printing and Export
-------------------

Tagaini is a computer application, and some of the best times to study are
those long hours spent commuting on trains, in waiting rooms or, for students,
between classes. Unless you drag a laptop around with you everywhere, you
won't have access to Tagaini or its study features, so instead you can print
out sets from the results or lists view, by selecting the desired print option
from the menu of the first icon in their tool bar.

![Print preview](images/print_preview.png)

Tagaini can print two different types of paper media. Lists of vocabulary or
kanji, and pocket-able booklets, vocabulary and kanji lists formatted in such a
way that the paper can be folded into a small, pocket sized, book. The
**print** option prints normally formatted lists, whilst the **print
booklet** option prints out booklets. Each option also has a preview
option.

![Printing a booklet](images/print_booklet.png)

What is printed is limited by what is in the results window. If a search has
turned up 60 entries, and Tagaini is set to only show 50 of those entries on a
page, then Tagaini will only print those 50 entries

At the bottom of the print menu there are two more options. **Export as
TSV...** and **Export as HTML...**.
The TSV option exports the set or list as a tab separated file. This option
exports entries as a plain text file, with entries formatted:

    漢字	    かな	    Romaji

or

    Expression	    Reading	    Meaning

This was originally written for exporting to anki[^ankifoot], a flash card
program, but will work with any other application that can import entries in
this format.

The export to HTML option exports a single HTML file, or web page, that can be
opened in a web browser. When opened in a Web browser it will, at first,
display a large box in which will be a single entries meaning and reading.
This box will display each flash card in the set once. The start button bellow
the frame will shuffle the flash cards and start showing them from the
beginning. The next button is used to go to the next entry. Across the top are
two radio buttons that read **Writing** and **Meaning + Reading**. Checking
the Writing button causes the next entry's kanji or writing to be displayed. 

The menu button, just to the right of this (currently a big **X**) displays a
menu with two options: **List** and **Flashcards**. Choosing the list option
changes the page to display a list of every entry in the exported set. The
Flashcard option returns you to the flash card page.

Importing and exporting user data 
---------------------------------

User data can be exported and imported from Tagaini. This allows you to move
study lists, tags, notes and other things Tagaini remembers between versions.
The **export user data** item in the **program** menu saves out a small data
base with these settings, so that another instance of Tagaini may load it,
whether it is another user on the same computer or on a different computer
altogether.


Preferences
===========

The preferences window provides the ability to edit Tagaini's look, feel and
how it handles several things. It can be opened via **Program ->
Preferences**.

It is a window with a menu down the left, containing the different pages.
Options for each page are located on the right of the menu.

General
-------

![General Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_gen.png)

The general preferences page, the one that the preferences window opens on,
contains general settings that affect the entire program. It is broken down
into several sections, visibly separated on the page.

The first section, from the top, is the **general settings** section. It
controls the **application-wide default font**, the font which Tagaini uses to
display text by default, and the **GUI language**, the language the menues and
buttons are written in. The default font has two settings. A check box labelled
**default** and a button labelled '**Change...**'. If the default check-box is
ticked then the default Qt system font is used. The change button brings up
a dialogue that allows you to select a new font. 

The next section is the dates section. It allows you to tell Tagaini which day
the week starts on: Sunday or Monday. These settings are used by your study
list. The following section allows you to tell Tagaini how often it should
connect to the internet and check for a new version. You can turn this
functionality off or you can get it to check for updates to the development
version. 

The **Entries cache** section specifies how many entries Tagaini will keep in
memory. Increasing this value may result in better performance for users
manipulating a huge number of entries, but the default should be safe for most
cases.

Results View
------------

![Results View Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_results.png)

The results view page specifies how entries are displayed in the search panel.

The page is separated into two sections: The **results display** section and
the **preview** section. The preview section shows an example of a list of
entries that will be displayed in the results view.

The results display section specifies the format of each entry. **Smooth
scrolling** changes how scrolling behaves. The number of entries per page can
be changed, as well as how results are sorted: `By score, then relevance` or
just `by relevance`. Entries can be displayed on one line, or over two with
the definition underneath the reading. 

Each of the different parts of a listed entry can then be displayed in a
different font; The **main writing** section is the first kanji or kana which
shows how it is usually written. **Readings and alternative writings**
specifies how readings are displayed and **definitions** refers to the Romaji
text that the meaning of the entry is displayed in. The default font is a
system default.

Detailed View
-------------

![Detailed View Preferences](images/tagaini_pref_detail.png)

The detailed view preferences page describes how the detailed view should be
displayed.

The **fonts** section specifies each font used in the detailed view. There are
five in all.

**Default text**
:   The font to use with any non-Japanese characters. 

**Kana header**
:   The red furigana reading, centred above the large kanji text.

**Kanji header**
:   The large centred kanji text, signifying the main reading.

**Kanji**
:   Any kanji in the display, for alternative writings and referenced entries.

**Kana**
:   Any kana in the display, for alternative readings and referenced entries.

Lists
-----

The lists page describes how lists should be handled and displayed. The
**style** of the list can be changed between **one line** entries and **two
line** entries. The fonts used to display the **main writing**, **Readings and
alternative writings** and **definitions** can each be changed separately.
**Smooth scrolling** can also be enabled.

Vocabulary Entries
------------------

![Vocabulary Display](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_dis.png)

The **basic information** section specifies whether or not the entries JLPT
level and information about the kanji used are displayed in the detailed view.

The **additional information** controls extra jobs about the displayed entry.
**Search for transitive／intransitive verb buddy** controls whether or a
references is included to an entry with an opposite transitive state. It is
also possible to search for a given number of **Homophones** or
**Homographs**. The **Studied only** check-box causes only homophones or
homographs in the study list to be displayed.

![Vocabulary Printing](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_printing.png)

The **printing** tab defines how entries look when printed. The **general**
section has the header's (The main reading) **font size** and the **maximum
number of definitions**.

The **kanji** section specifies whether or not to show each kanji's meaning
separately underneath the header, and if only to show studied kanji.

![Vocabulary Definition Filtering](images/tagaini_pref_vocab_filter.png)

The **definition filtering** allows the filtering of Terms. By default,
obsolete terms and archaisms are filtered out. This stops entries marked as
such from being found by searches. To filter out additional categories, select
them in the **displayed** section and press the arrow button that points to
the **filtered** section.

Kanji Entries
-------------

![Kanji Display](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_disp.png)

The **display** tab, the first of four tabs on the kanji entries page,
describes which information should be displayed in the detailed view.

In **basic information**, there are a series of check-boxes relating to
different pieces of information in the entry. Each one toggles display of that
element on and off.

**Readings**
:   On and Kun readings.

**Nanori**
:   Nanori reading.

many **words using the kanji** are shown.

**Components**
:   The kanji radicals used in the kanji.

![Kanji Printing](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_print.png)

The **printing** tab controls how kanji entries look when printed.

The **kanji information** section controls what is displayed, whilst **Kanji
drawing style** controls the appearance of the kanji - either hand-drawn
rendering or system font. **Preview** is an updating preview, using the entry
for 間.

The values in **kanji information** are:

**Meaning**
:   The kanji's meaning

**Onyomi**
:   The **on** reading, or 音読み。

**Kunyomi**

In the **kanji drawing style** section the kanji's size is set, along with if
it is written in a handwritten font, or in the default font, whether or not it
is printed on a gird and if the stroke numbers should be included.

![Kanji ToolTips](images/tagaini_pref_kanji_tooltip.png)

The kanji tool tip, that shows up when the mouse is hovering over a kanji in

popup.

Troubleshooting
==================

Unable to read Japanese
-----------------------

If you are unable to read Japanese text, you probably don't have any Japanese
fonts installed. You will likely have to install the Japanese language pack in
windows and Mac OS X. To get Japanese support in Linux please see your
distribution's documentation, if the information and links provided in
Tagaini's Install Guide were insufficient.

Unable to type Japanese text
----------------------------

Inputting Japanese text is not handled by Tagaini, instead by what is called
an Input Manager. You will need to install and use one of these to input
Japanese text. For instructions on installing an IM, please see Tagaini's
install guide.

Tagaini won't compile from GIT
------------------------------

Tagaini depends on SQLite and various dictionaries sources, which are included
into source releases but not into the Git repository. To compile from Git, you
first have to get these external dependencies. This is the first command you
need to run, from the install guides compiling from git section.

     $ ./prepare-source.sh

You may then proceed to the usual compilation process using CMake.

Other Bugs
----------

If you have an issue that is not listed above, you may wish to check Tagaini's
bug tracker on [launchpad][btfoot], or the [mailing lists][mailfoot]. Chances
are that someone else has already reported the problem and a work around has
been posted. If no one else has reported the bug, then please feel free to do
so.
